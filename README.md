# Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

🧠 **Overview**

A machine learning project to classify SMS/email messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using the SMSSpamCollection dataset.
Text data is cleaned, converted to numerical form using TF-IDF, and multiple models are compared for accuracy.

⚙️ **Tech Stack**

Python, Pandas, NumPy

NLTK for text preprocessing

Scikit-learn for ML models and evaluation

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

🧩 **Workflow**

*Data cleaning (lowercase, remove stopwords & punctuation)

TF-IDF feature extraction

Model training – Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.

Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion matrix visualization

📊 **Results**

**Model	Accuracy**

Naive Bayes	0.977

Logistic Regression	0.982

SVM	0.986

Random Forest	0.975
